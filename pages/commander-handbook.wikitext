The Rookie Missions are a series of missions aimed at Commanders new to the game. There are '''9 mission phases''' in total, which each phase containing a handful of missions. Completing '''6 missions''' within a given phase unlocks the missions in the next phase. Completing all the missions across all phases gives completion rewards. When all missions across all 9 phases are completed, the players receives a '''Rookie Mission Invitation'''. This item can be used to redeem one of two UR-rarity shipgirls: [[Shinano]] or [[New Jersey]].

Completing these missions will give the player items that can be used in the [[Research#Shipyard|Development Dock]], such as [[File:CombatDataPack.png|30px|link=]] [[Shipyard#Combat Data Packs|'''Combat Data Packs''']] and [[Shipyard#Enhancing|'''Blueprints''']]. 

The player can choose a shipgirl from a particular development series to advance these missions with. You don't have to start with Series 1!

'''Once you unlock development missions, ALL missions of a particular series need to be cleared before you can switch to missions from other series.'''

PR1 and PR2 series have 100% identical missions, the only difference being the Combat Data Pack series rewarded, and the final blueprints awarded, PR3/PR4/PR5 only slightly diverge.
