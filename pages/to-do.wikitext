This page is a '''to-do list''' with tasks that need to be done. Please be '''specific''' when outlining what needs to be done here.

Use [[Template:Todo]] to bullet-list tasks by priority when possible. If a task is finished, move it to the bottom and label it as <code><nowiki>{{Todo|done|task}}</nowiki></code>, or remove it entirely.

== New Game Update Checklist ==
When Azur Lane updates, these are the priorities of what should be done.

== To-Do List ==
Outside of adding new game content, this is '''specific''' existing content that needs to get updated. If you are already working on something, please link a sandbox or any pages on the line-item.

=== Major Items ===
:{{Todo|high|Follow the [[#New Game Update Checklist|New Game Update Checklist]] "Add event information" section for [[The Alchemist and the Tower of Horizons]].}}
:{{Todo|high|Follow the [[#New Game Update Checklist|New Game Update Checklist]] for the August 7th 2025 and August 14th 2025 maintenances.}}
::* [https://azurlane.yo-star.com/news/2025/08/13/maintenance-notice-8-14-12-a-m-utc-7/ Maintenance Notice - 8/14] (EN 7th Anniversary Event)
::* [https://azurlane.yo-star.com/news/2025/08/06/maintenance-notice-8-7-12-a-m-utc-7/ Maintenance Notice - 8/7]
:{{Todo|high|Create wiki page(s) for '''Private Quarters''' (3D Dorm).}}
:{{Todo|med|Finish wiki page(s) for [[Project Identity]].}}
:{{Todo|med|Finish wiki page(s) for [[Commander Handbook]].}}

=== Smaller Items ===
:{{Todo|med|Update UI Images in [[Shops]] and [[Akashi's Shop]] with new UI after August 14th 2025 update.}}
:{{Todo|med|Update the category label of every single item in [[:Category:Skins]] to '''Category:Ship skins''', preferably with a bot.}}
:{{Todo|med|Fix bullet ranges for Weapons.}}
:{{Todo|med|Adapt usages of the "Main" template to the new format (Template:Main!link!display -> Template:Main![[link|display]]).}}
:{{Todo|low|Remove <code>ScrapIncome</code> across every shippage. This task will take a while, and the params have been disabled in [[Template:Ship]], so there's no rush.}}
:{{Todo|low|Replace all mentions of plates with parts, preferably with a bot.}}
:{{Todo|low|Change Strenghtening Unit > General Blueprint, preferably with a bot, but this needs manual verification especially when dealing with hyperlinks.}}

=== Large Undertakings ===
These are refactorings / overhauls that will improve the wiki but are very complicated to implement.

:{{Todo|med|Improve Barrage handling on wiki.}}
::*{{Todo|med|Update [[Module:ShipBarrage/data]] and [[Module:ShipBarrage/data2]] with updated information.}}
::* [https://github.com/samheart564/al-barrage-datamine This GitHub repository] has the tools necessary to extract the information, but it requires some updates to handle the new barrage data structure from [https://github.com/MrLar/AzurLaneData AzurLaneData].
::* {{Todo|low|Update the Ship Template / Module to store barrage data on a per-skill basis.}}
::* {{Todo|low|Bring back "barrage gifs".}}
:{{Todo|low|Make the wiki dark-mode compatible.}}
::* Current progress can be found [[User:Nobbyfix/dark_mode_progress|here]].
:{{Todo|low|Add historical notes to individual ship pages as necessary. Please do not go overboard.}}
::* For example, the [[Enterprise]] page has a variety of historical notes in both her quotes and skills, especially on her Quotes page. The "Trivia" section is unecessary; do not add it when editing ship pages, but don't remove it on existing pages either.

== Will Not Fix ==
These items will not be worked on due to the reasons listed.

:{{Todo||Fix the [[Barrage]] tables not sorting correctly.}}
::*Sorting when each part of the barrage is its own tablerow (<code><nowiki><tr></nowiki></code>) is very complicated. This would require a massive refactor. Do it if you dare.

<!--
== Translation ==
=== Main Requests ===
Please remember to refer to the [[Translation Guide]] as you are translating content on the wiki.

* Translate any missing [[:Category:Ships_without_JP_translation|Japanese ship lines]] or [[:Category:Ships_without_CN_translation|Chinese ship lines]]
*Add any missing [[:Category:Skin_missing_JP_Translation|Japanese skin names]] or [[:Category:Skin_missing_CN_Translation|Chinese skin names]]
-->

== Maintenance ==
If you want a change-of-pace, you can perform the following maintenance tasks to ensure the wiki is clean and up-to-date.

=== Event currency and resource icons ===
* Add any event currency icons to [[:Category:Event point icons]]
* Add any missing resource icons to [[:Category:Resource icons]]

=== Skill icons ===
'''Number of missing skill icons:'''
{{#cargo_query:|tables=ship_skills|fields=COUNT(ship_skills._pageName)|where="Icon" IS NULL AND NOT "Name" = 'Full Barrage' AND NOT "Name" = 'All Out Assault'}}

Visit individual ship pages and '''manually''' correct the skill ID numbers in <code>Skill1Icon</code>, <code>Skill2Icon</code>, <code>Skill3Icon</code>, etc., when necessary.

{{#cargo_query:
|tables=ship_skills
|fields=_pageName, Num, Name, Detail, Type, Icon
|where="Icon" IS NULL AND NOT "Name" = 'Full Barrage' AND NOT "Name" = 'All Out Assault'
|limit=0
|format=table
|more results text=Click here to view all Missing Skill Icons
}}

=== File Duplicates ===
Run through [https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Special:ListDuplicatedFiles this list] as necessary and make sure to avoid having a ridiculous number of duplicate files. Queue them for deleting with <code><nowiki>{{Delete}}</nowiki></code>.

Duplicate skill icons and .gif bullet pattern files are fine. VA audio files, other images, icons, etc. are not.

=== Template Management ===
{{Todo|low|Provide, or update, documentation for:}}
* [[Template:RarityLevel]]
* [[Template:ColorClass]]
* [[Template:SkinFileData]]
* [[Template:Image Gallery]]
* [[Template:ContentBox]]

=== General Maintenance ===
* Check categories in [[Special:TrackingCategories]] when necessary. It is ideal to keep these tracking categories empty, or have them remain as red links when not needed.
* Check [[:Category:Candidates for deletion]] as necessary. When the total number of items in this category exceed 1000+, schedule a cleanup.
: - The total number of items includes counts for "Subcategories", "Pages in category 'Candidates for deletion'", and "Media in category 'Candidates for deletion'".

== Missing Cargo information ==
The following links take you to a list of pages where information is missing. If you want a change-of-pace, you can fill in the missing information.
